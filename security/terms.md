# ARP Poisoning

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning convinces a machine that you are the gateway.

# CISA

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a component of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection across all levels of government, coordinating cybersecurity programs with U.S. states, and improving the government's cybersecurity protections against private and nation-state hackers.

The agency began in 2007 as the DHS National Protection and Programs Directorate.

# Strict-Transport-Security

The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) informs browsers that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS.

> Note: This is more secure than simply configuring a HTTP to HTTPS (301) redirect on your server, where the initial HTTP connection is still vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack.

SSL/TLS port numbers are the numeric values that specify which port on the web server and web browser will use for the SSL/TLS communication. The default port number for HTTP is 80, while the default port number for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) is 443.
