# pull
The `pull` command is a combination of `fetch` and `merge`. Pull is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 

Usage: `git pull`

# pull from origin
Pulling from the `origin`  fetches a copy of the given branch from the original repository and merges it with the current branch checked out.

Usage: `git pull origin <branch_name>
